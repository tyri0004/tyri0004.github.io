            <h3>Tags</h3>
            <dl>
                <dt>Paragraph Tag</dt>
                
                <dd>The paragraph tag contains the structure of a less than symbol, a "p", and then a greater than symbol It also contains a closing tag that follows a similar structure, but has a slash after the less than symbol. The paragraph tag defines a paragraph and allows for larger amounts of text to be more condensed a readable. It is usually within a parent tag, and does not stand on its own.</dd>
                
                <dt>Line break tag</dt>
                
                <dd>The line break tag is a singular tag, meaning that it does not have a closing tag and stands on its own. The structure of a line break tag contains the less than symbol, the letters "br", then a greater than symbol It is used to break up the text and make space since html does not recognize space made within the code, we use the line break tag to make said space.</dd>
                
                <dt>Heading Tags</dt>
                
                <dd>Heading tags contain the structure of a less than symbol, an "h1,2,3...", and a greater than symbol. It also contains a closing tag, which is the same as whatever number of heading used, but with a slash after the less than symbol. The h1 tag would be classified as the most important heading, the h2 tag the second most, and so on. The numbers of headings determine their size, the h1 being the largest. The numbers for heading tags only go up to 6.</dd>
                
                <dt>Main Tag</dt>
                
                <dd>The main tag has the structure of a less than symbol, the text "main", and a greater than symbol, the closing tag has a slash after the less than symbol. The main tag is for all of the central content on the page.</dd>
                
                <dt>The Navigation Tag</dt>
            
                <dd>The navigation tag is used to navigate the page and will contain any links on the website. It has the structure of a less than symbol, then the letters "nav", and a greater than symbol, it also has a closing tag which contains a slash just after the less than symbol.</dd>
