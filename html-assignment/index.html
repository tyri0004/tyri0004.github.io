                <h3>About me</h3>
                <p>Hi there! My name is <em>Sam Tyrie!</em> I was born on the 3<sup>rd</sup> of December in Ottawa, Ontario. I love reading mystery and horror novels, rock climbing, and listening to heavy rock tunes. My favourite band of <strong>ALL TIME</strong> is <em>Royal Blood.</em> The reason I love <em>Royal Blood</em> so much is not only because of the interesting sounds they create by only being a bassist and drummer, they also have create such an cool and fun vibe with their music.</p>

                <h4>Why I joined the <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> Program</h4>
                <p>After I graduated high school, I knew that I at least wanted to take 1 year off, I didn't know that it would result in two years. I ended up working at a donut shop for those two years as a baker, then after 1 year, <em>the head baker</em>. It was unfulfilling, and ended I up getting a personal training certificate to try and get any type of career, but it didn't pan out. I always loved creating, writing, and anything creative. When I ended up on the Algonquin website and saw the <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> program, I was surprised that it had everything in the program that I was wanting to learn, so I joined. I'm currently enjoying my time in the program greatly, and the course delivery from all the professors has been <strong>insanely</strong> impressive and eye opening. Thank you <em>Prof. Rob</em> for teaching us code!</p>

                <h4>A little bit more about me :)</h4>
                <p>Currently, I rock climb at Altitude Gym in Orleans, and as of right now, I'm climbing greens, which is the third level at that gym. It's so much fun! Right now, I'm reading a mystery novel about a sorority girl that gets murdered and thrown into a lake. I also recently found a new band called <em>GooseBerry</em> that has released some pretty sick songs.</p>
                <p>That's all you need to know about me!</p>
