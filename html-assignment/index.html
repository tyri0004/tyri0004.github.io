                <h3>About me</h3>
                <p>Hi there! My name is <em>Sam Tyrie!</em> I was born on the 3<sup>rd</sup> of December in Ottawa, Ontario. I love reading, rock climbing, and listening to heavy rock tunes. My favourite band of <strong>ALL TIME</strong> is <em>Royal Blood.</em> The reason I love <em>Royal Blood</em> so much is not only because of the interesting sounds they create by only being a bassist and drummer, but they also have create such an cool and fun vibe with their music.</p>
