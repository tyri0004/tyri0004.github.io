                <h3>About me</h3>
                <p>Hi there! My name is <em>Sam Tyrie!</em> I was born on the 3<sup>rd</sup> of December in Ottawa, Ontario. I love reading mysteries and horror novels, rock climbing, and listening to heavy rock tunes. My favourite band of <strong>ALL TIME</strong> is <em>Royal Blood.</em> The reason I love <em>Royal Blood</em> so much is not only because of the interesting sounds they create by only being a bassist and drummer, but they also have create such an cool and fun vibe with their music.</p>

                <h4>Why I joined the <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> Program</h4>
                <p>After I graduated high school, I knew that I at least wanted to take 1 year off, I didn't know that it would result in two years. I ended up working at a donut shop for those two years as a baker, then after 1 year, the head baker. It was unfulfilling, and ended up getting a personal training certificate to try and get any type of career, but it didn't pan out. I always loved creating, writing, and anything creative, and when I ended up on the Algonquin website and saw the <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> program, I was surprised that it met everything that I was looking to learn, so I joined. I'm currently enjoying my time in the program greatly, and the course delivery from all the professors has been <strong>insanely</strong> impressive and eye opening. Thank you <em>Prof. Rob</em> for teaching us code!</p>
